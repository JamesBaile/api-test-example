# api-test-example
An example of outside in testing

All of the code is faitrly rough and meant for demonstration purposes only.

Using standard packages it's possible to test without writing any code, relying on test definitions expressed in a standard way. This is potentially a compelling approach in a micro-services architecture especially as the number of services increases. It means that you develop a standard technology agnostic mechanism of testing services from the outside.
